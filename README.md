# CEG3120 - Project 1
# Sam Schafer
I created a user on my Ubuntu AWS server called git and added ssh permissions and keys to that user.
I then cloned my ceg3120 github repository to the server.
I updated this README.md and added screen shots for proof of what was done above.
I then commited and pushed to github and then fetched all the updates on my Ubuntu AWS server and pull/merged the changes onto that server.
